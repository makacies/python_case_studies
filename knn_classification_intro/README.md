## Notes
>It turns out that using a value for k that's too large or too small
is not optimal.
A phenomenon that is known as the `bias-variance tradeoff`.
This suggests that some intermediate values of k might be best.
We will not talk more about it here,
but for this application, using k equal to 5 is a reasonable choice.
